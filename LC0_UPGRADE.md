## 🚀 **Major Upgrade: Leela Chess Zero Integration**

Your chess analysis system now uses **Leela Chess Zero (LC0)**, one of the world's strongest chess engines!

### 🔧 **What Changed**

**Before**: Custom GPT-2 model with limited chess knowledge
**After**: Leela Chess Zero neural network with professional-level analysis

### 🎯 **Current System Architecture**

```
Frontend (React)
    ↓ uploads chess board image
Backend (FastAPI)
    ↓ analyzes image with Gemini Vision API
    ↓ extracts FEN position
    ↓ sends to LC0 engine
LC0 Neural Network
    ↓ analyzes position with neural network
    ↓ returns best move + confidence
Frontend
    ↓ displays professional analysis
```

### 🏆 **LC0 Advantages**

-   **Professional Strength**: ~3000+ ELO rating (superhuman level)
-   **Neural Network**: Deep learning trained on millions of games
-   **Real Analysis**: Actual position evaluation, not style mimicking
-   **Reliable**: Consistent, high-quality move suggestions
-   **Fast**: 1-second analysis time for responsive UI

### 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Feature  | GPT-2 Model     | LC0 Engine     |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| Strength | ~1200 ELO       | ~3000+ ELO     |
| Analysis | Text-based      | Neural network |
| Speed    | Fast            | Very fast (1s) |
| Accuracy | Limited         | Professional   |
| Training | Style mimicking | Actual chess   |
