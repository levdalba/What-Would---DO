# Magnus Carlsen Style Chess Analyzer

A React-TypeScript application that analyzes chess positions and recommends moves based on Magnus Carlsen's playing style using a trained neural network.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Interactive Chess Board

-   Drag and drop pieces to set up positions
-   Real-time position analysis
-   Move history tracking
-   Board reset functionality

### ðŸ“· Image Upload Analysis

-   Upload chess board images for analysis
-   Optical chess recognition (planned feature)
-   Position extraction from images

### ðŸ§  AI-Powered Analysis

-   **Magnus Carlsen Style Prediction**: Uses your trained neural network at `http://10.224.9.93:8000/predict`
-   **Confidence Scoring**: Shows prediction confidence percentage
-   **Move Explanations**: AI-generated explanations for recommended moves
-   **Style Analysis**: Understanding of Magnus's positional preferences

## API Integration

The application integrates with your trained Magnus Carlsen model:

**Endpoint**: `http://10.224.9.93:8000/predict`

**Request Format**:

```json
{
    "board": "r2q1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n1bn2/1p2p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQR1K1"
}
```

**Response Format**:

```json
{
    "predicted_move": "h2h3",
    "confidence": 69.0
}
```

## Recent Improvements

## Model Training Notes

Your Magnus Carlsen model appears to be trained on FEN positions and returns moves in algebraic notation. The confidence scoring provides good feedback on prediction quality.

For optimal results:

-   Ensure training data covers various game phases (opening, middlegame, endgame)
-   Consider position evaluation alongside move prediction
-   Monitor prediction accuracy across different position types
